# 7-Segment example

This example needs to be updated before it's ready. please check back for updates.

The goal of this example is to display hexadecimal value on a 7-segment connected to the fpga.

7 IOs on the header B on the Breakout board are used for the display.

The 7-segment display I use is a common cathode and IOs have to be set to 0 in order to iluminate the segment.
